## Description

Implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe with a web browser frontend and a node/Express backend.
The backend isn't really necessary but I wanted to play around with node/Express.

## TODO

* Randomly decide who goes first.
* Allow the player to choose `X` or `O`.
* Currently, the computer move is chosen randomly. Implement a better strategy.
* Implement multiple strategies and allow the player to choose a level.
* Maintain stats over several games
